# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
## Purpose
Tasked with analyzing Amazon reviews, I have to see how well the Amazon Vine program is doing. This is a big decision to make sure that we are not wasting recources on the program.

## Results
The Amazon reviews that I was looking at were the video game veriety. Here are some bullet points of the results:
- There were 4,291 Vine reviews in total. There were also 1,781,706 non-Vine reviews. This pie graph shows just how much of a difference between how many actually use Vine:

-It isn't much difference with the 5 star reviews between Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews. With only 48 5 star reviews for Vine, the non-Vine 5 star reviews outnumber number them vastly with 15,663. Here is the pie graph of that:
