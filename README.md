# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
## Purpose
Tasked with analyzing Amazon reviews, I have to see how well the Amazon Vine program is doing. This is a big decision to make sure that we are not wasting recources on the program.

## Results
The Amazon reviews that I was looking at were the video game veriety. Here are some bullet points of the results:
- There were 4,291 Vine reviews in total. There were also 1,781,706 non-Vine reviews. This pie graph shows just how much of a difference between how many actually use Vine:

- There is a significantly different out look comparing the total number of vines with the 5 star vines. There are 1,607 5 star vines and 4,291 total vine reviews. Here is a pie chart of that:

There is also a huge difference between the 5 star reviews with the total for non-Vine program. There is 1,025,317 five star reviews and 1,781,706 total reviews of non-Vine program. Here is a graph of that:

- The amount of total vines that were 5 star reviews were 1,607 and the total amount of vine reviews were 4,291. After calculating that out, the percentage is just 37.4% of total reviews that give it 5 stars. This is in contrast to the non-Vine Paid program of 1,025,317 reviews of 5 stars out of 1,781,706. That percentage comes out to 57.5% of total reviews that were 5 stars. 

## Summary
There seems to be no positivity bias in this Vine reviews. In fact, paying seems to get less 5 stars than the non paying program. The contrast of 37.4% of Vines getting 5 star reviews and 57.5%  of non-Vine reviews gives clarity to the previous statement. I would like to see the ratio of negative reviews as well to confirm that the reviewers might go in the middle of the road to both protect their reputation and not anger the people paying.
